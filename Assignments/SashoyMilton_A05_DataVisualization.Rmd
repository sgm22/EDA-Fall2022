## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on Data Visualization 

## Directions
1. Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A02_CodingBasics.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.

The completed exercise is due on Friday, Oct 21st @ 5:00pm.



## Set up your session 

1. Set up your session. Verify your working directory and load the tidyverse, 
lubridate, & cowplot packages. Upload the NTL-LTER processed data files for  
nutrients and chemistry/physics for Peter and Paul Lakes (use the tidy 
[`NTL-LTER_Lake_Chemistry_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv`] version) and 
the processed data file for the Niwot Ridge litter dataset (use the
[`NEON_NIWO_Litter_mass_trap_Processed.csv`] version). 

2. Make sure R is reading dates as date format; if not change the format to date.

```{r Load and check data}

#1. Verify working directory

getwd()

#b.Load packages

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library (cowplot)

#c. Load datasets

lake_chemistry <- read.csv("../Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Lake_Chemistry_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

litter_dat <- read.csv("../Data/Processed/NEON_NIWO_Litter_mass_trap_Processed.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#2. Check that date is in date format

### Lake Chemistry data set

class(lake_chemistry$sampledate)
lake_chemistry$sampledate <- ymd(lake_chemistry$sampledate)
class(lake_chemistry$sampledate) # Recheck class of data
lake_chemistry  #View data to view variable

### Litter data set

class(litter_dat$collectDate)
litter_dat$collectDate <- ymd(litter_dat$collectDate)
class(litter_dat$collectDate) #Recheck class of data
litter_dat

```
## Define your theme

3. Build a theme and set it as your default theme.

```{r Building my theme}

#3. Building a theme

my_theme <- theme_bw(base_size = 12) + theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), legend.position = "top", legend.justification = "center") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
theme_set(my_theme)
  
```

## Create graphs

For numbers 4-7, create ggplot graphs and adjust aesthetics to follow best 
practices for data visualization. Ensure your theme, color palettes, axes, 
and additional aesthetics are edited accordingly.

4. [NTL-LTER] Plot total phosphorus (`tp_ug`) by phosphate (`po4`), with 
separate aesthetics for Peter and Paul lakes. Add a line of best fit and 
color it black. Adjust your axes to hide extreme values (hint: change the 
limits using `xlim()` and/or `ylim()`).

```{r,warning=FALSE}

#4. Plot of total phosphorus by phosphate

  ggplot(lake_chemistry, aes(x = tp_ug, y = po4, color=lakename)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth (method = lm, color = "black") +
  xlab("Phosphate") +
  ylab ("Total phosphorus/ug") +
  ylim(0,200) + 
  ggtitle("Total phosphorus by phosphate 
  for Peter and Paul Lakes") +
  labs (color = "Lake's Name")

```


5. [NTL-LTER] Make three separate boxplots of (a) temperature, (b) TP, and 
(c) TN, with month as the x axis and lake as a color aesthetic. Then, create 
a cowplot that combines the three graphs. Make sure that only one legend is 
present and that graph axes are aligned. 

Tip: R has a build in variable called `month.abb` that returns a list of months;
see <https://r-lang.com/month-abb-in-r-with-example>

```{r}
#5. Boxplots of Temperature, TP, and TN

#### Separate boxplots


temp.plot <- ggplot(lake_chemistry, aes(x = month, y= temperature_C)) +
  geom_boxplot (aes(color = factor(lakename))) +
  xlab ("Month") +
  ylab ("Temperature/ degrees in Celsius") +
  ggtitle(" Boxplot of Temperature of Peter and Paul Lake") +
  labs (color = "Name of Lake")

temp.plot #View graph

nitrogen.plot <- ggplot(lake_chemistry, aes (x = month, y = tn_ug)) +
  geom_boxplot (aes(color = lakename)) +
  xlab ("Month") +
  ylab ("Total Nitrogen/ug") +
  ggtitle(" Boxplot of Total Nitrogen of Peter and Paul Lake") +
  labs (color = "Name of Lake")

nitrogen.plot #View graph

phosphorus.plot <- ggplot(lake_chemistry, aes (x = month, y = tp_ug)) +
  geom_boxplot (aes(color = lakename)) +
  xlab ("Month") +
  ylab ("Total phosphorous/ ug") +
  ggtitle(" Boxplot of Total Phosphorus of Peter and Paul Lake") +
  labs (color = "Name of Lake")

phosphorus.plot #View plot

### Joint Plot

aligned_plots <- align_plots(plotlist = temp.plot, nitrogen.plot,phosphorus.plot, align = "vh", axis = "tblr")
ggdraw(aligned_plots [[1]])



```

Question: What do you observe about the variables of interest over seasons 
and between lakes? 

> Answer: 

6. [Niwot Ridge] Plot a subset of the litter dataset by displaying only the 
"Needles" functional group. Plot the dry mass of needle litter by date and 
separate by NLCD class with a color aesthetic. (no need to adjust the name 
of each land use)

7. [Niwot Ridge] Now, plot the same plot but with NLCD classes separated into 
three facets rather than separated by color. 

```{r Niwot Ridge}

#6. 

subset_litter_dat <- litter_dat %>%
  filter(functionalGroup == "Needles") 

subset_litter_dat #View data

ggplot(subset_litter_dat,aes(x = month(collectDate), y = dryMass, color = nlcdClass)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab ("Month of Collection") +
  ylab ("Dry Mass of Needle Litter") +
  ggtitle(" Distribution of Dry Mass of Needle Litter Over Time") +
  labs (color = "NLCD Class")


#7

ggplot(subset_litter_dat, aes(x = month(collectDate), y = dryMass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(nlcdClass), nrow = 3) +
  ylab ("Dry Mass of Needle Litter") +
  xlab ("Month of Collection") +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect (color = "black", fill = "green")) +
   ggtitle(" Distribution of Dry Mass of Needle Litter Over Time")


```
Question: Which of these plots (6 vs. 7) do you think is more effective, and why? 

The plot with the NLCD classes separated into three facets rather than separated by color is more effective. WHHHYYYY??
